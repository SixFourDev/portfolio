                    <h2>About Me</h2>
                    <p>
                        My name is Shane Browning, and I am 28 years old and live in San Diego, CA.
                        I am attending the UCSD Extended Studies Coding Boot Camp, stepping into this new journey of web
                        development and coding.
                        I have a lot of knowledge in crypto and blockchain technology which inspired me to take this
                        step, and
                        hoping to be able
                        to work in the web3 space, and build some highly developed applications in the future! I am a
                        motivated
                        and driven individual who loves
                        problem solving, and loves working with groups to create something incredible. I am hardworking
                        and
                        dedicated, and also a perfectionist
                        to make sure everything works perfectly.

                <h2>Crypto Experience</h2>
                <p>
                    I started getting interested in the crypto world around 2017 when one of my good friends
                    told me about Bitcoin and XRP. I fell in love with the tech, and have been researching
                    and trading ever since. Fast forward to 2021, my friends and I created our own project on
                    the Solana Blockchain called "Solana Hills". We developed
                    this runner game with our assets that we've created, and that's what really got me to dive
                    deeper and want to learn how to code and become a developer so I could build these
                    really cool applications myself in the future. I also pictured two of my favorite NFTs I
                    hold from "The Degenerate Ape Academy". Overall, I have a passion in web3, and want to
                    create and build
                    useful tools and applications in the community.
